# RetroVision
RetroVision is a google extension that turns your browser to look retro style.!!! I was planning on uploading it to the google extension store.. but they practically want the decleration of indepence plus 2 days!!!! (also 5 dollars) DETAILS ON HOW TO GET IT WORKING BELOW
Coded in CSS, HTML, JS, And technically json

It basically injects custom themes i made so almost every website looks just like it did 10 years ago!!

I did not put this on the google extensions store for a few reasons,
Google was being really annoying about privicy data even though im not collecting any of it,
Google was trying to put me through in depth review saying it will delay publishing
it would make a lot of reasons to make me not want to upload as it appears it was made for more developers not small hobbyist.
(also i heard it takes a really long time for them to approve it)


By doing it the way of importing it yourself it makes it so i dont have to get it approved by google.
